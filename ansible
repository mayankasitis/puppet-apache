Windows Server Ansible Requirement:
1.	Ansible requires PowerShell 3.0 or newer and at least .NET 4.0 to be installed on the Windows host.
2.	A WinRM listener should be created and activated.

Check PowerShell version:
$host.Version 
Check .Net version : Run below command on powershell or cmd:
reg query "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Net Framework Setup\NDP" /s

There are two main components of the WinRM service that governs how Ansible can interface with the Windows host: the listener and the service configuration settings.
 ConfigureRemotingForAnsible.ps1 can be used to set up the basics. This script sets up both HTTP and HTTPS listeners with a self-signed certificate and enables the Basic authentication option on the service.
To use this script, run the following in PowerShell:
$url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ansible/ansible/devel/examples/scripts/ConfigureRemotingForAnsible.ps1"
$file = "$env:temp\ConfigureRemotingForAnsible.ps1"

(New-Object -TypeName System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile($url, $file)

powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -File $file
Winrm http port : 5985 , https port : 5986
To view the current listeners that are running on the WinRM service, run the following command:
winrm enumerate winrm/config/Listener


Run the following command to get the WinRM configuration.
winrm get winrm/config
on Ansible server :
yum install python-pip
pip install
